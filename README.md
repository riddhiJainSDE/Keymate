# KeyMate
 

## Overview  
KeyMate is a **secure password management application** that encrypts and stores user credentials, ensuring they remain protected and accessible only to authorized user.  

It uses **RSA encryption**, where each client generates a **unique public-private key pair** to encrypt and decrypt passwords locally. The client can also **regenerate keys** at any time for enhanced security. Additionally, the server manages its own **encryption keys**, adding an extra layer of protection when storing passwords in the database.  

With **end-to-end encryption (E2EE)**, KeyMate is a highly secure and privacy-focused solution. üöÄ  


## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack  
- **MongoDB** - NoSQL database for storing user data.
- **Express.js** - Web application framework for Node.js.
- **React.js** - Frontend framework for building the user interface.
- **Node.js** - Backend runtime environment.
- **RSA Module** - Used for password encryption and decryption.
- **JWT** - Token-based authentication for user sessions.
- **NodeMailer** - Used for the forgot password functionality, sending emails.
- **Tailwind** - Designing Frontend UI.


## ‚ú® Features  

- **User Authentication** ‚Äì Secure **login & registration** with **JWT**  
- **Secure Password Storage** ‚Äì Uses **RSA encryption** for storing and retrieving passwords securely  
- **End-to-End Encryption (E2EE)** ‚Äì Passwords are **encrypted before leaving the client** and decrypted only when accessed securely  
- **Client-Side Key Management** ‚Äì Users generate **strong RSA key pairs** (public & private) on their device, ensuring **zero-knowledge encryption**  
- **Server-Side Encryption Layer** ‚Äì Server **encrypts and decrypts data** using its own **secure key pair**, adding an additional **security layer**  
- **Regenerate Keys Option** ‚Äì Users can **regenerate RSA keys** anytime, improving security and control  
- **Update & Delete Passwords** ‚Äì Manage stored passwords securely  
- **Forgot Password Recovery** ‚Äì Reset passwords via **email** using **NodeMailer**  
- **Fully Responsive UI** ‚Äì Works on **all screen sizes**  


This ensures **maximum security** by keeping **private keys client-side** while allowing the server to manage encrypted data effectively. üöÄ
